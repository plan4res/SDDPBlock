# SDDPBlock

SMS++ Block and Solver for multistage stochastic programming problems.

## Getting started

These instructions will let you build SDDPBlock on your system.

### Requirements

- [SMS++ StochasticBlock](https://gitlab.com/smspp/stochasticblock)
- [STochastic OPTimization library (StOpt)](https://gitlab.com/stochastic-control/StOpt)

### Build and install with CMake

Configure and build the library with:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The library has the same configuration options of
[SMS++](https://gitlab.com/smspp/smspp-project/-/wikis/Customize-the-configuration).

Optionally, install the library in the system with:

```sh
sudo make install
```

### Usage with CMake

After the library is built, you can use it in your CMake project with:

```cmake
find_package(SDDPBlock)
target_link_libraries(<my_target> SMS++::SDDPBlock)
```
